Project Title:
Fusion-of-Psycholinguistic-Features-in-Fake-Review-Detection-Model (This is for my undergraduate thesis)

Project Description:
•            Operated Reality Monitoring (Hauch, 2015) theory to make correlation analysis, identifying significant features related to cognitive load, 
emotional attitude, spatial details, and sensory perception from review texts.
•            Implemented a novel fake review detection model that incorporated psycholinguistic features within a multi-layer attention mechanism 
architecture. This architecture contributed to parse reviews at different granularities, including word, sentence, and paragraph levels, to 
enhance context understanding.
•            Achieved a significant improvement over baseline models(BERT) in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score.  Emphasized textual 
indicators of deception, leading to a more robust and effective detection system.
